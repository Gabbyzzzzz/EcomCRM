<objective>
Wire up the webhook and unsubscribe endpoints that complete the email compliance loop. Resend bounce webhooks suppress addresses, the unsubscribe page confirms opt-out with undo, and Shopify tags sync on unsubscribe.

Purpose: Without these endpoints, bounces go unhandled and unsubscribe links are dead — sending is technically possible from Plan 01 but not compliant. This plan closes the compliance gap.
Output: Resend webhook handler, unsubscribe API + page, Shopify tag sync, updated Inngest functions
</objective>

**Resend webhook endpoint at `src/app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts`:**

Create a POST handler that receives Resend webhook events. Resend sends JSON payloads with a `type` field.

Per Resend docs, webhook events include:
- `email.bounced` — contains `{ type: 'email.bounced', data: { email_id, from, to, bounce_type, ... } }`
- `email.complained` — spam complaint, treat same as unsubscribe

**Verification:** Resend webhooks can be verified using a webhook signing secret. However, for simplicity (Resend's verification is optional), use IP-based or skip verification with a TODO for production. Alternatively, use the `svix` library if Resend uses Svix for signing (check Resend SDK). For now, parse the body, validate the structure with Zod, and process.

**Handler logic:**

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod'
import { inngest } from '@/inngest/client'

const resendWebhookSchema = z.object({
  type: z.string(),
  data: z.object({
    email_id: z.string().optional(),
    from: z.string().optional(),
    to: z.union([z.string(), z.array(z.string())]).optional(),
    bounce_type: z.string().optional(),  // 'hard' or 'soft' for bounce events
  }).passthrough(),
})

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json()
  const parsed = resendWebhookSchema.safeParse(body)
  if (!parsed.success) {
    return new Response('Bad Request', { status: 400 })
  }

  // Dispatch to Inngest for async processing (same pattern as Shopify webhooks)
  await inngest.send({
    name: 'resend/webhook.received',
    data: parsed.data,
  })

  return new Response('OK', { status: 200 })
}
```

**Inngest function `processResendWebhook` in `src/inngest/functions.ts`:**

Add a new Inngest function that handles Resend webhook events:

```typescript
export const processResendWebhook = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'process-resend-webhook', retries: 3 },
  { event: 'resend/webhook.received' },
  async ({ event }) => {
    const { type, data } = event.data as { type: string; data: Record<string, unknown> }
    const shopId = getShopId()

    // Extract recipient email(s)
    const toField = data.to
    const emails: string[] = Array.isArray(toField) ? toField : (typeof toField === 'string' ? [toField] : [])

    switch (type) {
      case 'email.bounced': {
        const bounceType = data.bounce_type as string | undefined
        // Only suppress on HARD bounce — soft bounces are transient (per locked decision)
        if (bounceType === 'hard') {
          for (const email of emails) {
            await insertSuppression(shopId, email, 'hard_bounce')
            // Also set marketing_opted_out on the customer if they exist
            const customer = await getCustomerByEmail(shopId, email)
            if (customer) {
              await setMarketingOptedOut(shopId, customer.id, true)
            }
          }
        }
        break
      }
      case 'email.complained': {
        // Spam complaint — treat as unsubscribe
        for (const email of emails) {
          await insertSuppression(shopId, email, 'unsubscribe')
          const customer = await getCustomerByEmail(shopId, email)
          if (customer) {
            await setMarketingOptedOut(shopId, customer.id, true)
          }
        }
        break
      }
      default:
        console.log(`[resend-webhook] Unhandled event type: ${type}`)
    }
  }
)
```

Add `processResendWebhook` to the exported `functions` array.

Import the necessary query functions at the top of `functions.ts`:
```typescript
import {
  insertSuppression,
  setMarketingOptedOut,
  getCustomerByEmail,
  getCustomerByInternalId,
  removeSuppression,
} from '@/lib/db/queries'
```

**Unsubscribe API at `src/app/api/unsubscribe/route.ts`:**

Two endpoints:

**POST** — One-click unsubscribe (EMAIL-05 compliance). Called by email clients that support `List-Unsubscribe-Post`.
- Read the token from the request body (form-encoded: `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`) or from query params.
- Verify the token using `verifyUnsubscribeToken`.
- If valid: call `setMarketingOptedOut(shopId, customerId, true)`, call `insertSuppression(shopId, email, 'unsubscribe')`.
- Sync to Shopify: Use `shopifyGraphQL` to add the `'unsubscribed'` tag to the customer's Shopify record. The mutation is:
  ```graphql
  mutation addTags($id: ID!, $tags: [String!]!) {
    tagsAdd(id: $id, tags: $tags) {
      userErrors { field message }
    }
  }
  ```
  Where `id` is the customer's Shopify GID (from `customer.shopifyId`), and `tags` is `['unsubscribed']`.
- Return 200 OK.

**GET** — Redirect to unsubscribe page. Used when someone clicks the link in email.
- Read `token` from query params.
- Verify token.
- If valid: perform the same unsubscribe actions as POST (set opt-out, insert suppression, sync Shopify tag).
- Redirect to `/unsubscribe?token=${token}&done=true`.
- If invalid token: redirect to `/unsubscribe?error=invalid`.

**Add `getCustomerByShopifyId` to `src/lib/db/queries.ts`** if not already present — needed to look up a customer by their Shopify GID for the tag sync mutation. Actually, `verifyUnsubscribeToken` returns `customerId` (internal UUID), so use `getCustomerByInternalId` to get the shopifyId.

Add a helper function to `src/lib/db/queries.ts`:
```typescript
/**
 * Find a customer by their internal UUID and shopId.
 * Returns the full customer row or null.
 */
export async function getCustomerByInternalId(shopId: string, customerInternalId: string) {
  // ... select from customers where id = customerInternalId and shopId = shopId
}
```
(This should already be created in Plan 01, Task 1. If so, just use it.)

  <name>Task 2: Unsubscribe confirmation page with undo</name>
  <files>
    src/app/unsubscribe/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Unsubscribe page at `src/app/unsubscribe/page.tsx`:**

This is a Next.js Server Component page that shows the unsubscribe confirmation.

**URL patterns:**
- `/unsubscribe?token=xxx&done=true` — Successfully unsubscribed
- `/unsubscribe?token=xxx&resubscribed=true` — Successfully re-subscribed (undo worked)
- `/unsubscribe?error=invalid` — Invalid or expired token

**Page behavior:**

Read `searchParams` (token, done, resubscribed, error).

1. **Error state** (`error=invalid`): Show "Invalid or expired unsubscribe link" message. Simple centered card with error text.

2. **Unsubscribed state** (`done=true`): Show "You've been unsubscribed" with:
   - Clear confirmation: "You will no longer receive marketing emails from this store."
   - **Undo link**: A link/button that calls `POST /api/unsubscribe` with `action=resubscribe&token=xxx`. This re-subscribes the customer (removes suppression, sets marketing_opted_out=false, removes 'unsubscribed' tag from Shopify).
   - "Changed your mind?" text above the undo button.

3. **Re-subscribed state** (`resubscribed=true`): Show "You've been re-subscribed" with confirmation text: "You will continue to receive marketing emails."

**Design per locked decision:** Simple, clean page. Use Tailwind for styling. Centered card layout, minimal branding (store name from a `storeName` query param if available, or generic text).

The undo action requires a form or client-side fetch. Since the page is a Server Component, use a `<form>` with `action` attribute pointing to the API route, or create a minimal Client Component for the undo button.

**Approach:** Use Next.js Server Actions or a simple `<form method="POST" action="/api/unsubscribe">` with hidden inputs for `token` and `action=resubscribe`. The API route handles the resubscribe:
- Verify token
- Call `setMarketingOptedOut(shopId, customerId, false)`
- Call `removeSuppression(shopId, email)`
- Sync to Shopify: remove the `'unsubscribed'` tag using `tagsRemove` mutation
- Redirect to `/unsubscribe?token=xxx&resubscribed=true`

Add the resubscribe handling to the existing `POST /api/unsubscribe/route.ts`:
- If body contains `action=resubscribe` and a valid token, perform the reverse operations.
- If body contains `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`, perform the unsubscribe (already handled in Task 1).

**Shopify tag removal mutation:**
```graphql
mutation removeTags($id: ID!, $tags: [String!]!) {
  tagsRemove(id: $id, tags: $tags) {
    userErrors { field message }
  }
}
```

The page should use standard HTML/Tailwind without shadcn/ui dependencies to keep it lightweight (public-facing page, not part of the dashboard). Use the same color scheme as the email templates for visual consistency: primary blue `#2563eb`, text gray-800, background gray-50.
  </action>

    1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
